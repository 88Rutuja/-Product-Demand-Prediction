# -Product-Demand-Prediction

You must have studied that the demand for a product varies with the change in its price. If you take real-world examples, you will see if the product is not a necessity, then its demand decreases with the increase in its price and the demand increases with the decrease in its price. If you want to know how we can predict demand for a product with machine learning, this article is for you. In this article, I will walk you through the task of product demand prediction with machine learning using Python.


Problem Statement:-
A product company plans to offer discounts on its product during the upcoming holiday season. The company wants to find the price at which its product can be a better deal compared to its competitors. For this task, the company provided a dataset of past changes in sales based on price changes. You need to train a model that can predict the demand for the product in the market with different price segments.



The dataset that we have for this task contains data about:

the product id;
store id;
total price at which product was sold;
base price at which product was sold;
Units sold (quantity demanded);



Conclusion:-

After observing the problem statement we have build an efficient model to overcome it. 
The above model helps in predicting the demand for a product varies with the change in its price. 
Price is one of the major factors that affect the demand for the product. 
If a product is not a necessity, only a few people buy the product even if the price increases.
The accuracy for the prediction is 46.17%.
